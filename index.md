# Microsoft Azure Tech Intensity Workshop
The workshop is oriented to those in an architectural or consultant role with beginning to intermediate Microsoft Azure knowledge. It's recommended that the [Azure Fundamentals course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals) be completed first, or equivalent instruction or experience. 

>NOTE: This training is not intended for sales roles or for more advanced topics. 

## Hybrid Cloud Labs
The labs documented here are part of the workshop event that equips to build hybrid solutions with Microsoft Azure as fundamentals to further develop consulting practices, solution offerings, and managed services.  

### Hybrid Identity 
Connect an on-premises Active Directory to Azure Active Directory and synchronize users.  If time permits, you’ll publish applications to cloud-based users. 

### Migration 
We’ll start by talking about our robust migration strategy and tool set and then get hands-on migrating a database from on-prem to Azure SQL. Use Azure Site Recovery next to migrate a virtual machine to the cloud.

### Networking 
We’ll cover the core components of Azure networking including virtual networks, peering, network security groups (NSGs), Load Balancers, Traffic Manager, and Network Watcher.  We take fun to the next level by building out all these components and integrating them together in the lab.  

### Solution Design 
Work with a team to design a hybrid architecture for a simulated real-world customer case study.  The team must prepare a presentation of the solution to the CTO in a mock Architectural Design Session (ADS) seeking approval for a pilot.
